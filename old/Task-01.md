# Workbook One - HTML

## Task 1. Getting Started

[Download the zip file html-one.zip]() and extract the `html-one` folder as instructed in class.

- This folder contains all relevant exercise files
- Save all files created during this workbook to the `html-one` folder.
- Delete the zip file once extracted to avoid confusion.

## Task 1.2 HTML editor.

At MMU you will find a variety of editors installed including Notepad++, Sublime Text, Brackets and Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Installations vary from room to room. 

Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code will be installed in all rooms we teach.

The Visual Studio Code editor is open source and free to install on your own Mac or PC. It is also fast becoming an industry favourite. Note that **Visual Studio Code** is a different app to [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

>If you are using your own laptop in class download and install [MicroSoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


## Task 1.3 Open a file in your HTML editor.

Follow these steps:

1.	Open Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code editor
2.	Select Open Folder
3.	Navigate to the workbook01 folder on your H drive (or laptop)
4.	Select Open
5.	The assets (the files and sub-folder) in that folder are now displayed on the left pane of the application window.

## Task 1.4 Open a web browser.

Find, select and open Google Chrome.

We recommend using Chrome or Firefox if possible.

Avoid Internet Explorer.

### Using a variety of browsers

If you are using a Mac the default browser is Safari. If you can, also install Chrome and Firefox.

It is important to view your web pages in different browsers as they may display your pages differently.

As a web developer you will become keenly aware of the problems that may arise trying to get web pages to display satisfactorily. There can be a number of factors:

* The operating system, Mac, PC, iOS, Android etc.
* Make of web browser, Internet Explorer (IE), Firefox, Safari or Google Chrome. 
* Version of web browser, ie. IE8, IE9 or IE10 etc.
* Size of users’ device - Laptop, PC, Mac, Smart phone, tablet.

By creating standards-based pages we aim to help avoid many of these issues.

### Screen size

If you are using a desktop computer the screen is likely to be a reasonable sized, widescreen monitor. Make use of the screen space – don't maximise applications. On a laptop you may have a number of 'virtual' screens that you can use at any one time.

Ultimately, you'll find your own way of working but make sure it is both efficient and effective. Learn keyboard shortcuts like `alt-tab` (command-tab) to swop between programmes, `ctrl-s` (command-s) to save and `F5` to refresh your web browser.

## Things to know

### Testing

Testing on a variety of browsers,devices and platforms is common practice in web development.

### No spaces

On the web we avoid spaces in both file names and folder names. 

Why? If we load up a file called `hello world.html` in a browser what we get is:

`hello%20world.html`

The `%20` not only looks ugly, but it is hard to read. 

So what do we do? 

Common examples are:

* `hello-world.html` using a hyphen
* `hello_world.html` using an underscore
* `helloworld.html` losing the space completely.

The secret is to select a method and stick with it. That will ensure consistency throughout your web site. Just remember, NO SPACES in file names.

### No CAPS

Only use lowercase letters when naming files and folders. 

It just makes life simpler for you as the developer, and for your user who then doesn’t need to know if that is `helloworld.html` or `HelloWorld.html`. 

Simple, **NO CAPS**.

MS Windows especially likes to mess this up by putting Capitals on file and folder names by default. Don’t worry. It’s only when you start uploading files to the web that you need to enforce lower case. 

Don’t write CAPS in your code. For example `<p>` rather than `<P>`.

### `.html` suffix (or file extension)

Much as MSWord files has the `.docx` suffix to allow it to identify files as MSWord files, for web pages we use the suffix `.html` to identify HTML pages.

You may come across `.htm` as the suffix for web pages but this is just a hangover from the days of *MS DOS*, when we could only use three characters for the file extension. **Always use** `.html`

### HTML files are plain text files

`.html` files are simple plain text documents. You may have come across `.txt` files. 
Unlike `.doc`, `.ppt` or other file formats plain text files only carry simple formatting such as paragraph breaks. This means they are light (in file size) and quick to load.

This is part of the success of the World Wide Web.

## Task 2. Creating a Simple HTML Document

You will create a simple HTML document using a text editor and then view the document using a web browser.
